#This is the config file for the Rhythm Tool
#The '#' char denotes a comment and the program will skip lines that start with '#'
#The order of data is important: i.e. don't place "Music Directory" below "BPM Save File Directory"

#Provide the full path to the music location
#"./" is the default
#non-latin characters in the path / music title will break the program 
#Make sure to end the path with "/"
Music Directory:
./

#Provide the full path to the BPM save file
#"./" is the default
#if "BPM" doesn't exist, it will be created once a BPM is saved
BPM Save File Directory:
./
